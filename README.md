# Form Validation Plugin

Sure, a million of these exist but I'm developing a lightweight solution that I can chuck into small projects and forget about.

## Details
 - **Version** - 0.1.0
 - **Author** - [Thomas Banks](http://scrummable.com)
 - **Status** - In development

## Boilerplate
```
-- index.html
-- style.css
-- main.js
```
The idea being that these files are largely irrelevant as can be switched for any form with any styling.  
`main.js` will become more important as this is where the plugin will be initialised (although, obviously, that could be in any JavaScript file - even using an in-page script tag!)
